# python-command-line-application


## Technologies Used
* Python
* Peewee
* PostgreSQL
* CLI

## Description & Features
The python command line application is a full CRUD capability application that was built to be used as note tracker via the command line. The app utilizes peewee as an object relational mapper (ORM) and PostgreSQL as the database. 

Peewee is a simple and small ORM tool. It automates the transfer of data between the code and the database. Users can create a new note, search for an existing one, and update or delete a note. The notes are stored in PostgreSQL.

## Getting Started
* Fork and clone the repository and open the code in your preferred text editor.
* Open a tab in your terminal and execute the command pipenv run python project.py
* The command line will then run you through a series of prompts in order to interact with the application.

## Goals
In the future, I would like to improve upon this API by...
* Implementing some more prompts in my code, making it easier for the user to interact with the application.
* Print the note that the user is attempting to edit that it is visibly that they are editing the correct one.
